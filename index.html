                        <p> " I believe art is a gift to enrich one’s life,
                            A luxury to experience and enjoy every day.
                            At Natori, we bring art into everything we do.
                            Each piece is designed and crafted
                            To be a personal treasure –
                            A modern harmony of East and West.
                            A sensual palette of color and texture.
                            A glamorous thread to weave into your life,
                            Reflecting your inner world,
                            Empowering your outer world.
                            To me, indulgence is a necessity…
                            As a woman, a traveler, a collector,
                            I know the joy of exploring, the magic of expressing
                            One’s every mood through objects of desire.
                            As a classical pianist,
                            I know one never plays the same note twice.
                            There’s always an element of surprise and discovery,
                            An evolving, unfolding adventure of what’s to come."</p>
